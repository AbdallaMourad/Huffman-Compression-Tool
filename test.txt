MATHEMATICSPREVALENT IN CURRENT SIGNAL PROCESSING RESEARCH AND PRACTICE  THE GAPIS BRIDGED BY PROVIDING A UNIFIED EM APPLIED TREATMENT OFFUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICS SEASONED WITH DEMONSTRATIONS USING SC  MATLAB  THIS BOOK INTENDED NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS OF SIGNALPROCESSING STILL PURSUING THEIR FORMAL EDUCATION BUT ALSO FORPRACTICING ENGINEERS WHO NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SIGNALPROCESSING RESEARCH LITERATURE AND FOR RESEARCHERS LOOKING FOR APARTICULAR RESULT THAT THEY WANT TO APPLY  IT IS THUS INTENDED BOTHAS A BF TEXTBOOK AND AS A BF REFERENCE  THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF SIGNAL PROCESSING

OF A PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE BY SETTING UP A SIGNALRECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM AND THEN OPTIMIZING THE PARAMETERS OF THEALGORITHM FOR OPTIMUM PERFORMANCE  MOST PRACTICING SIGNAL PROCESSORSMUST HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH THE BF THEORY AND THE BF  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MATHEMATICS HOW AND WHY IT WORKS AND HOW TOMAKE THE COMPUTER DO IT  THE BREADTH OF MATHEMATICS EMPLOYED INSIGNAL PROCESSING COUPLED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY THE MATH TOPROBLEMS OF ENGINEERING INTEREST MAKES THE FIELD BOTH INTERESTING ANDREWARDINGTHE MATHEMATICAL ASPECTS OF SIGNAL PROCESSING ALSO INTRODUCE SOME OFITS MAJOR CHALLENGES HOW IS A STUDENT OR ENGINEERING PRACTITIONER TOBECOME VERSED IN THE VARIETY OF MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES WHILE STILLKEEPING AN EYE TOWARD THE APPLICATIONS  INTRODUCTORY TEXTS ON SIGNALPROCESSING TEND TO FOCUS HEAVILY ON TRANSFORM TECHNIQUES ANDFILTERBASED APPLICATIONS  WHILE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE TRAINING OFA SIGNAL PROCESSOR THIS FOCUS REVEALS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OFMATERIAL REQUIRED BY A LIFELONG PRACTICING ENGINEER  MORE ADVANCEDTEXTS USUALLY DEVELOP THE MATHEMATICAL TOOLS SPECIFIC TO A NARROWASPECT OF SIGNAL PROCESSING WHILE PERHAPS MISSING CONNECTIONS OFTHESE IDEAS TO RELATED AREAS OF RESEARCH  NEITHER OF THESE APPROACHESPROVIDES THE BACKGROUND NECESSARY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND BROADLY INTHE SIGNAL PROCESSING RESEARCH LITERATURE NOR TO EQUIP A PERSON WITHMANY SIGNAL PROCESSING

THESE COURSES CAN PROVIDESECTIONFEATURES OF THE BOOKSOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BOOK INCLUDEBEGINITEMIZEITEM AN EMPHASIS ON VECTORSPACE GEOMETRY WHICH PUTS LEASTSQUARES  AND MINIMUM MEANSQUARES IN THE SAME FRAMEWORK  THE CONCEPT OF  SIGNALS AS VECTORS IN AN APPROPRIATE VECTOR SPACE IS EMPHASIZED  THE VECTOR SPACE APPROACH PROVIDES A NATURAL FRAMEWORK FOR TOPICS  SUCH AS WAVELET TRANSFORMS AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL AS  THE TRADITIONAL TOPICS SUCH AS OPTIMUM PREDICTION FILTERING AND  ESTIMATION  IN THIS CONTEXT THE MORE GENERAL NOTION OF METRIC  SPACES IS INTRODUCED WITH A DISCUSSION OF SIGNAL NORMSITEM A THOROUGH DESCRIPTION OF THE LINEAR ALGEBRA USED IN SIGNAL  PROCESSING BOTH IN CONCEPT AND IN NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION  WHILE  LIBRARIES ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE TO DO LINEAR ALGEBRA COMPUTATIONS  WE FEEL THAT THE NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES PRESENTED EXERCISE INTUITION  ON THE GEOMETRY OF VECTOR SPACES AND BUILD UNDERSTANDING OF THE  ISSUES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IN PRACTICAL PROBLEMS  THE LINEAR ALGEBRA INCLUDES A THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF EIGENBASED  METHOD OF COMPUTATION INCLUDING EIGENFILTERS MUSIC AND ESPRIT  THERE IS ALSO A CHAPTER DEVOTED TO THE PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS  OF THE SVD  TOEPLITZ MATRICES WHICH APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE SIGNAL  PROCESSING LITERATURE ARE TREATED BOTH FROM A NUMERICAL POINT OF  VIEW  AS AN EXAMPLE OF RECURSIVE ALGORITHMS  AND ALSO IN  CONJUNCTION WITH THE LATTICEFILTERING INTERPRETATION      THE MATRICES IN LINEAR ALGEBRA ARE VIEWED AS OPERATORS AND THE  IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF AN OPERATOR IS INTRODUCED  ASSOCIATED NOTIONS  SUCH AS RANGE NULLSPACE AND NORM OF AN OPERATOR ARE PRESENTED  WHILE A FULL COVERAGE OF OPERATOR THEORY IS NOT PROVIDED THERE IS A  STRONG FOUNDATION HERE THAT SERVES TO BUILD INSIGHT FOR OTHER  OPERATORS  ITEM IN ADDITION TO THE LINEAR ALGEBRAIC CONCEPTS A DISCUSSION OF  EM COMPUTATION IS ALSO PRESENTED  ALGORITHMS FOR COMPUTING THE  COMMON FACTORIZATIONS EIGENVALUES EIGENVECTORS SVDS AND MANY  OTHERS ARE PRESENTED WITH SOME NUMERICAL CONSIDERATION FOR  IMPLEMENTATION  WHILE NOT ALL OF THIS MATERIAL IS NECESSARILY  INTENDED FOR CLASSROOM USE IN CONVENTIONAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CLASSES   THERE IS NOT TIME FOR ALL OF THIS IN MOST CLASSES  THE  MATERIAL PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE TO PERSPECTIVE  PRACTITIONERS AND A STARTING POINT FOR IMPLEMENTATIONS ON OTHER  PLATFORMS  INSTRUCTORS MAY CHOOSE TO EMPHASIZE CERTAIN NUMERIC  CONCEPTS BECAUSE THEY HIGHLIGHT THE GEOMETRY OF VECTOR SPACES  ITEM THE CAUCHYSCHWARTZ INEQUALITY IS USED IN A VARIETY OF PLACES AS  AN OPTIMIZING PRINCIPLEITEM RLS AND LMS ADAPTIVE FILTERS ARE PRESENTED AS NATURAL OUTGROWTHS  OF MORE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS MATRIX INVERSE UPDATES AND STEEPEST  DESCENT  NEURAL NETWORKS AND BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION ARE ALSO  PRESENTED AS AN APPLICATION OF STEEPEST DESCENTITEM SEVERAL CHAPTERS ARE DEVOTED TO ITERATIVE AND RECURSIVE METHODS  EMPLOYED IN SIGNAL PROCESSING  WHILE ITERATIVE METHODS ARE OF GREAT  THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE NO OTHER SIGNAL PROCESSING  TEXTBOOK PROVIDES THIS BREADTH OF COVERAGE  METHODS PRESENTED  INCLUDE PROJECTION ON CONVEX SETS COMPOSITE MAPPING THE EM  ALGORITHM CONJUGATE GRADIENT AND METHODS OF MATRIX INVERSE  COMPUTATION USING ITERATIVE METHODSITEM DETECTION AND ESTIMATION ARE PRESENTED WITH SEVERAL  APPLICATIONS INCLUDING SPECTRUM ESTIMATION PHASE ESTIMATION AND  MULTIDIMENSIONAL DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONSITEM OPTIMIZATION IS A KEY CONCEPT ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND EXAMPLES  OF OPTIMIZATION BOTH UNCONSTRAINED AND CONSTRAINED APPEAR  THROUGHOUT THE TEXT  A

BEEN TO EXPLAIN THE WHAT ANDWHY OF THE MATHEMATICS BUT WITHOUT BECOMING OVERWROUGHT WITH SOMEOF THE MORE TECHNICAL MATHEMATICAL OCCUPATIONS  IN THIS REGARD THEBOOK DOES NOT NECESSARILY THOROUGHLY
